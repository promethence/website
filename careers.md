# Join Promethence

We are a research-oriented startup based in Milan, Italy, working at the intersection of **quantum computing**, **cryptography**, and **compilation**.

While we are not currently hiring for full-time roles, we are **open to internships and research collaborations** with motivated individuals who share our values: **openness**, **rigor**, **privacy**, and **ethics**.

## Internship Opportunities

Are you a student or early-career researcher interested in:

- Quantum cryptanalysis of post-quantum schemes?
- Low-level compilation for near-term quantum devices?
- Algorithmic design under physical and security constraints?

If you're curious, self-driven, and eager to work closely with a team of academics from **Politecnico di Milano**, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

### What We Offer

- Flexible, research-driven internship projects  
- Mentorship from professors and researchers in the field  
- Opportunities to co-author papers or contribute to open-source prototypes  
- Exposure to European research initiatives and innovation networks  

> We care more about **research interest** and **curiosity** than your current title or affiliation.
