# About Promethence

**Founded in Milan in 2025**, Promethence brings together deep academic
expertise in **quantum computing**, **cryptography**, and **compilation** to
explore the limits of secure and efficient computation.

We are a research-driven initiative backed by a team of professors, postdocs,
and Ph.D. researchers from *Politecnico di Milano*, committed to advancing
foundational and applied knowledge in post-quantum security and quantum
technologies.

## Mission

To bridge the gap between cutting-edge quantum theory and its real-world applications by designing, analyzing, and deploying quantum-secure and performance-aware computing tools.

> _Pushing the frontier of computation to empower secure, scalable, and ethical technology._

---

## What We Do

We conduct advanced research in:

- **Quantum Cryptanalysis**: Assessing the real-world resilience of post-quantum
  cryptographic schemes under quantum adversaries.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Designing and optimizing algorithms tailored for
  current and near-future quantum architectures.
- **Quantum Compilation**: Investigating novel compilation strategies, including
  approximate computing, to bridge high-level algorithm design and low-level
  quantum execution.

Our **technical depth and academic pedigree** set us apart in the rapidly
evolving field of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. Our expertise
supports collaborative research for institutions aiming to understand or build
in this fast-evolving field.
