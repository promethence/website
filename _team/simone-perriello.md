PostDoc at [Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB)](https://www.deib.polimi.it) â€“ [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it).
Part of the [quantum computing initiative](https://www.quantum.polimi.it).

My research revolves around the fields of quantum computing and cryptography. At
the moment, I am focusing on the design, development and cryptanalysis of
quantum algorithms to attack Post-Quantum Cryptosystems, with a specific focus
on the code-based finalists of [NIST
competition](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).

In my spare time, I like to play the ukulele, my loyal travelling companion.
Lately, I also discovered a passion for dance, with swing being my favorite
genre. I also love [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/tigerjack/),
[listening to
music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4aWxDlzZuOynhmmmXOHhDv?si=6192591721624709)
and [reading good books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117405756-simone).
